    "TF-IDF makes efficient judgement on what are the most important phrases that appears frequently yet also distinctively. While the algorithm does give us some tangible complaints and compliments to work on, we cannot reliably ensure that it can capture a majority of the complaints. For instance, if we select a `max_df` too high, then we will have many themes that are too common and do not make sense. Another limitation is that it does not understand the sentiment of the terms. Even in a negative review, there could still be compliments. Unless it is something that is very obviously negative, we cannot safely assume it is something that should be improved upon. Lastly, having a fixed n for ngram makes it less flexible to find more interesting phrases of different length (maybe we can solve the problem by considering both bi and tri gram, or use collocation)."
